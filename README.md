## About Me:
**Freelance Frontend Developer** and dedicated **Next.js Specialist**. I build and deliver production-grade web applications for startups and small businesses in the health and fitness sectors.

## 
-  💻 Over a decade developing web applications for startups and small businesses
-  🎓 Graduated Western Washington University with a BA in Management Information Systems
-  ⚙️ Typescript Focused: My go-to stack is **Next.js** with **Nest JS** or **Payload CMS**, depending on the project. I regularly convert Figma designs to working applications and work with backend engineers to implement API as necessary (Swagger/OpenAPI, GraphQL, or TRPC).
-  👍 Working on my own SAAS, but open to work on a select few projects.
